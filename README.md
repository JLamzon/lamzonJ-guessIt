// Guess It - data validation and play again

//Peer Review by Amardeep Mann: Good work with the play-again feature. Using the while loop was a great call for that. Choosing the game mode works well enough. For future evesions you may want to throw in a data validation to make sure the user picks a valid difficulty instead of going straight to "Play Again?" if they don't. The custom game mode also works pretty great. The only way I was able to break it is if I choose a maximum number that's lower than the min. You may want to add a check in the future to account for users being idiots since it will crash the program. All in all great work! I appreciates how you ask the user for their name to make for a more interactive experience
